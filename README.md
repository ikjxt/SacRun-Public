# SacRun-Public
SacRun is a game that I developed during my CSC 133, Object-Oriented Computer Graphics, course. Although I have worked on the game outside of class, I can not publish the code as future students may copy my work and this would violate my course agreement. This being said, I have a demo on youtube, along with this detailed ReadMe to showcase my project.
